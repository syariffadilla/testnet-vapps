## Technical

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js (NestJS)
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + optional EVM integration
- **Storage**: WALRUS + IPFS

### Features
1. On-chain posts & comments with proof of authenticity
2. Contribution-based reputation system
3. Community groups & real-time notifications

## Timeline

### PoC (3 weeks)
- [ ] SL identity contract
- [ ] Proof authenticity integration via Soundness Layer
- [ ] Simple UI feed

### MVP (6 weeks)
- [ ] Reputation system & user profiles
- [ ] Community groups (channels/threads)
- [ ] Real-time notifications & collaboration
- [ ] User testing & deployment

## Innovation
SoundLink enhances social media credibility by ensuring every post/comment has an on-chain proof.
With zkProof-based reputation, community interactions become healthier and resistant to manipulation, unlike traditional likes/followers systems.
